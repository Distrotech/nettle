{"name":"Nettle","tagline":"","body":"What is Nettle? A quote from the introduction in the Nettle Manual:\r\n\r\n  Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more\r\n  or less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages\r\n  (C++, Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in\r\n  kernel space. In most contexts, you need more than the basic\r\n  cryptographic algorithms, you also need some way to keep track of available\r\n  algorithms, their properties and variants. You often have some algorithm\r\n  selection process, often dictated by a protocol you want to implement.\r\n  \r\n  And as the requirements of applications differ in subtle and not so\r\n  subtle ways, an API that fits one application well can be a pain to use\r\n  in a different context. And that is why there are so many different\r\n  cryptographic libraries around.\r\n  \r\n  Nettle tries to avoid this problem by doing one thing, the low-level\r\n  crypto stuff, and providing a simple but general interface to it.\r\n  In particular, Nettle doesn't do algorithm selection. It doesn't do\r\n  memory allocation. It doesn't do any I/O.\r\n  \r\n  The idea is that one can build several application and context specific\r\n  interfaces on top of Nettle, and share the code, test cases, benchmarks,\r\n  documentation, etc. Examples are the Nettle module for the Pike\r\n  language, and LSH, which both use an object-oriented abstraction on top\r\n  of the library.\r\n\r\nNettle is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.

Mail me if you have any questions or\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nYou can also build Nettle from git, see\r\nhttp://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/ for current instructions.\r\n\r\nYou may want to subscribe to the nettle-bugs mailing list.
